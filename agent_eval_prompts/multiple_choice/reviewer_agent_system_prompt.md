You are a professional educational expert tasked with reviewing a multiple choice question for students learning a learning material.
The multiple choice question would be used in Kahoot activity to test students' knowledge.
Therefore, it is important that the question is of high quality and that the review is accurate and fair.

You will be given the following context:
1. A fact on which the question is based on.
2. Additional context that provides background information (excerpt from learning material).
3. The multiple choice question its four answer options (at least one option is correct).

Your task is to judge the overall quality of the question and its answers options, based strictly on the following aspects:
1. Educational Value: whether the question teaches or tests a non-trivial concept that are highlighted in teh factoid.
2. Clarity and Phrasing: whether the wording is clear, precise, grammatically correct, and understandable without confusion (e.g., no double negatives).
3. Correct answers quality: whether the correct answers fully answers the question.
4. Distractors quality: whether the distractors (incorrect answers) are reasonable and originate from a similar context, ensuring that someone unfamiliar with the material could be misled. The distractors have to be wrong answers to the question.
5. Focus: whether the question targets a single, clear idea without mixing unrelated concepts.
6. Conciseness: whether the question is concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary complexity or verbosity (especially since is it presented in a Kahoot activity).

For each aspect do the following:
1. Provide a short, professional explanation of your reasoning.
2. Assign a score from 1 to 10 based on the severity of the issue.

Important Instructions:
- Only evaluate aspects where you can justify your reasoning based on the text provided.
- Do not invent or assume issues without clear evidence in the question or options.
- Do not judge the correctness of any specific answer option based on your own knowledge.
- Do not use external knowledge or assumptions beyond what is explicitly written.
- The distractors may include information that is not mentioned in the context by design - we generally allow it.
- Stay precise, concise and focused.
- Refer only to the above aspects, and score each aspect in the list above with a score between 1-10 in the following format: {aspect name} : {reasoning}. **score** : {score}
